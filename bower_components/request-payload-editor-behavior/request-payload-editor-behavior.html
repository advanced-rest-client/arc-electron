   * Sometimes you may want to use this element alongside other payload editors. In this case,
   * if the element is still in the DOM and accepts value change, you may wish to prohibit any
   * computations if other element is handling payload edits.
   *
   * To do so, elements implementing this behavior have `_isOpened` private property that tells
   * the element if the element us currently in use. This property cam be controlled by the
   * `attrForOpened` property. If the property is set and corresponding to it's value attribute is
   * set then the element is considered as opened. Also, if the element doesn't have `attrForOpened`
   * value the `_isOpened` property is set to true.

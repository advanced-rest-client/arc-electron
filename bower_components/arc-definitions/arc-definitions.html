Request / response information data used in ARC.
Contains definitions for status codes and request and response headers.

The fileds may be empty when not yet initialized.

The `<arc-definitions>` element listens at its nearest shadow root boundary for query events.
Other elements can send the `query-headers` and `query-status-codes` events that will be
handled by this element. Events will be stopped from propagation. Event returned value will
contain the data.

### Example
```
<arc-definitions
  requests="{{requestsDefinitions}}"
  responses="{{responsesDefinitions}}"
  status-codes="{{statusCodesDefinitions}}"></arc-definitions>
```

### Firing events Example

```javascript
// Polymer 1.x
let event = this.fire('query-headers', {
  'type': 'request', // or response, mandatory
  'query': 'Acce' // finds all request headers containing `acce` in their name
}, {
  cancelable: true
});
console.log(event.defaultPrevented); // true
let headers = event.detail.headers;  // Array[]
```

```javascript
// Vanilla JavaScript
var event = new CustomEvent('query-headers', {
  detail: {
    'type': 'request',
    'query': 'Acce'
  },
  bubbles: true,
  composed: true,
  cancelable: true
});
document.body.dispatchEvent(event);
console.log(event.defaultPrevented); // true
let headers = event.detail.headers;  // Array[]
```

```javascript
let event = this.fire('query-status-codes', {
  'code': 200
}, {
  cancelable: true
});
console.log(event.defaultPrevented); // true
let statusCode = event.detail.statusCode;  // Array[]
```

```javascript
// Vanilla JavaScript
var event = new CustomEvent('query-status-codes', {
  detail: {
    'code': 200
  },
  bubbles: true,
  composed: true,
  cancelable: true
});
document.body.dispatchEvent(event);
console.log(event.defaultPrevented); // true
let statusCode = event.detail.statusCode; // Array[]
```

The event should be cancellable so the element can cancel it and other
instances of this element will not handle it again. Though it's not an error
dispatching this event as not cancelable.

If the element was handled by the element and the event is cancelable then
event's `defaultPrevented` flag is set to `true`.

If query event do not contain query value then all values for given query type
will be returned.

For example following event returns all request headers

```javascript
let event = this.fire('query-headers', {
  'type': 'request',
  'query': '' // it might be not defined.
}, {
  cancelable: true
});
```

      {"key":100, "label":"Continue","desc":"This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue)."},
      {"key":101, "label":"Switching Protocols","desc":"This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so"},
      {"key":102, "label":"Processing","desc":"As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet. This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost."},
      {"key":200, "label":"OK","desc":"Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action."},
      {"key":201, "label":"Created","desc":"The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created."},
      {"key":202, "label":"Accepted","desc":"The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place."},
      {"key":203, "label":"Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)","desc":"The server successfully processed the request, but is returning information that may be from another source."},
      {"key":204, "label":"No Content","desc":"The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content."},
      {"key":205, "label":"Reset Content","desc":"The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view."},
      {"key":206, "label":"Partial Content","desc":"The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by tools like wget to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams."},
      {"key":207, "label":"Multi-Status (WebDAV) (RFC 4918)","desc":"The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made."},
      {"key":300, "label":"Multiple Choices","desc":"Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow. It, for instance, could be used to present different format options for video, list files with different extensions, or word sense disambiguation."},

      {"key":302, "label":"Found","desc":"This is an example of industrial practice contradicting the standard. HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was \"Moved Temporarily\"), but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, the majority of Web applications and frameworks still use the 302 status code as if it were the 303."},
      {"key":303, "label":"See Other (since HTTP/1.1)","desc":"The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a PUT, it should be assumed that the server has received the data and the redirect should be issued with a separate GET message."},
      {"key":304, "label":"Not Modified","desc":"Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested. Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client."},
      {"key":305, "label":"Use Proxy (since HTTP/1.1)","desc":"Many HTTP clients (such as Mozilla and Internet Explorer) do not correctly handle responses with this status code, primarily for security reasons."},
      {"key":306, "label":"Switch Proxy","desc":"No longer used."},
      {"key":307, "label":"Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)","desc":"In this occasion, the request should be repeated with another URI, but future requests can still use the original URI. In contrast to 303, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request."},
      {"key":400, "label":"Bad Request","desc":"The request cannot be fulfilled due to bad syntax."},
      {"key":401, "label":"Unauthorized","desc":"Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but has failed or not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication."},
      {"key":402, "label":"Payment Required","desc":"Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. As an example of its use, however, Apple's MobileMe service generates a 402 error (\"httpStatusCode:402\" in the Mac OS X Console log) if the MobileMe account is delinquent."},
      {"key":403, "label":"Forbidden","desc":"The request was a legal request, but the server is refusing to respond to it. Unlike a 401 Unauthorized response, authenticating will make no difference."},
      {"key":404, "label":"Not Found","desc":"The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible."},
      {"key":405, "label":"Method Not Allowed","desc":"A request was made of a resource using a request method not supported by that resource; for example, using GET on a form which requires data to be presented via POST, or using PUT on a read-only resource."},
      {"key":406, "label":"Not Acceptable","desc":"The requested resource is only capable of generating content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request."},
      {"key":407, "label":"Proxy Authentication Required","desc":"This code is similar to 401 (Unauthorized), but indicates that the client must first authenticate itself with the proxy."},
      {"key":408, "label":"Request Timeout","desc":"The client did not produce a request within the time that the server was prepared to wait. The client MAY repeat the request without modifications at any later time."},
      {"key":409, "label":"Conflict","desc":"Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict."},
      {"key":410, "label":"Gone","desc":"Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.[2] This should be used when a resource has been intentionally removed and the resource should be purged. Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future."},
      {"key":411, "label":"Length Required","desc":"The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource."},
      {"key":412, "label":"Precondition Failed","desc":"The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request."},
      {"key":413, "label":"Request Entity Too Large","desc":"The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process."},
      {"key":414, "label":"Request-URI Too Long","desc":"The URI provided was too long for the server to process."},
      {"key":415, "label":"Unsupported Media Type","desc":"The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support.[2] For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format."},
      {"key":416, "label":"Requested Range Not Satisfiable","desc":"The client has asked for a portion of the file, but the server cannot supply that portion. For example, if the client asked for a part of the file that lies beyond the end of the file."},
      {"key":417, "label":"Expectation Failed","desc":"The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field."},
      {"key":418, "label":"I'm a teapot","desc":"This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fools' jokes, in RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers."},
